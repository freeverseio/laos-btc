Great, I’ll prepare a detailed guide on how to apply for Polkadot Treasury funding for your BRC721 protocol—focusing on building an indexer integrating Bitcoin and the LAOS parachain, which may require changes to LAOS itself. I’ll cover treasury proposals, bounties, and tips as potential paths, and tailor everything to your early-stage status and cross-chain architecture.

I’ll get back to you soon with a comprehensive guide.

# Guide to Polkadot Treasury Funding for a Cross-Chain NFT Project (BRC721)

**Introduction:**  
Polkadot’s on-chain treasury is a community-managed fund designed to finance projects that benefit its ecosystem ([Polkadot’s on-chain Treasury. Bounties, tips, and spending proposals | by Pitcoin | Medium](https://medium.com/@pitcoin/polkadots-on-chain-treasury-6a1e9a690827#:~:text=The%20Polkadot%27s%20treasury%20can%20be,and%20operations%20on%20the%20protocol)). For a cross-chain infrastructure project like **BRC721** – which uses the LAOS parachain and Bitcoin to enable inexpensive, dynamic NFTs on Bitcoin – securing Polkadot Treasury support can accelerate development. This guide provides a detailed roadmap for applying to the Polkadot Treasury, emphasizing clarity, technical precision, and alignment with Polkadot’s multi-chain vision. We cover the available funding avenues, how to craft and submit a proposal step-by-step, what criteria the community looks for, examples of successful proposals, best practices, common pitfalls, and key resources. 

## 1. Overview of Funding Options  
Polkadot offers **decentralized funding mechanisms** through its treasury, broadly categorized into spending proposals, bounties, and tips ([Polkadot’s on-chain Treasury. Bounties, tips, and spending proposals | by Pitcoin | Medium](https://medium.com/@pitcoin/polkadots-on-chain-treasury-6a1e9a690827#:~:text=,Council%20can%20evaluate%20%26%20review)). Each is suited for different types of contributions:

- **Treasury Proposals (Spending Proposals):** A standard way to request a **one-time allocation** of DOT from the treasury for a specific project or deliverable. These require an on-chain referendum (vote by DOT holders) for approval under Polkadot’s OpenGov system. Treasury proposals make up the largest share of treasury outflow and are intended for substantial initiatives that add value to the ecosystem ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=,happen%20within%20a%20spend%20period)). In practice, this route is similar to a grant: you propose a budget and scope, and if the community approves, the treasury will disburse the funds to your project.

- **Treasury Bounties:** Bounties reserve a **pool of DOT for a broader task or ongoing program**. A bounty is managed by a curator (often a multisig team) and can fund multiple sub-tasks (child bounties) without needing separate referenda for each ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=Getting%20treasury%20funding%20through%20OpenGov%2C,are%20also%20called%20parent%20bounties)) ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=Parent%20bounty%20proposals%20aim%20to,the%20benefit%20of%20the%20ecosystem)). This is useful if your goal involves **several phases or contributors** – for example, funding a series of development milestones or community events under the BRC721 project. The bounty is approved once via referendum (a parent bounty proposal), after which the curator can dispense funds to reward completion of each milestone (child bounties). Bounties thus provide flexibility for long-term or multi-part projects, though they require a capable curator to manage funds responsibly.

- **Tips:** The treasury tip system is designed for **small, ad-hoc rewards** to persons or teams who performed value-add work (e.g. writing documentation, fixing a bug, creating tutorials) ([Polkadot’s on-chain Treasury. Bounties, tips, and spending proposals | by Pitcoin | Medium](https://medium.com/@pitcoin/polkadots-on-chain-treasury-6a1e9a690827#:~:text=,Council%20can%20evaluate%20%26%20review)). Tips are typically used *after* the fact – someone proposes to tip a community member for their contribution, and the tip must then get endorsed (in Polkadot OpenGov, this happens via a fast-track tipping referendum). Tips are **quick, smaller payouts** (often relatively low DOT amounts) that can be approved within a single spend period ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=,happen%20within%20a%20spend%20period)). For a large development like BRC721, tips are likely not a primary funding route, but the team could receive tips for interim contributions (say, writing a technical article or releasing a useful tool) in addition to the main proposal.

**Which option to choose?** For developing and implementing BRC721 (which involves significant R&D, building an indexer across Bitcoin and a Polkadot parachain, and possibly modifying the parachain), a **Treasury Proposal** is the most appropriate route. It allows you to request a defined budget for the project’s next stage and get a one-time disbursement if approved. A **bounty** could be considered if you prefer to manage funds in a tranche and pay out to multiple collaborators (for example, if several independent developers will contribute to the BRC721 indexer, each working on separate components). Tips are not suitable for covering development costs but could complement the main funding by recognizing extra efforts from community contributors. 

## 2. Step-by-Step Application Process  
Applying for treasury funding is a multi-stage process. Below is a step-by-step guide tailored for a project like BRC721:

1. **Preparation and Research:**  
   - **Define Your Project Scope:** Clearly outline what the funding will cover – e.g. *“Building a cross-chain indexer for BRC721 NFTs, integrating Bitcoin and the LAOS parachain, and upgrading the LAOS runtime to support dynamic NFTs.”* Identify specific deliverables (such as a working indexer, updated smart contracts or pallets on LAOS, documentation, etc.).  
   - **Formal Documentation:** Prepare a detailed proposal document (in PDF or online doc format). This should include an **executive summary**, background on BRC721 and its significance, technical architecture plans, development roadmap, timeline, milestones, budget breakdown, and team bios. As a first-time treasury proposer, it’s wise to **“formalize and document everything in detail”** ([Creating a treasury proposal — Step by Step guide | by Polkassembly | Medium](https://polkassembly.medium.com/creating-a-treasury-proposal-step-by-step-guide-e65ee1283193#:~:text=So%2C%20in%20the%20previous%20article,about%20making%20a%20treasury%20proposal)). Reviewing past successful proposals on Polkassembly can guide you on the level of detail expected ([Creating a treasury proposal — Step by Step guide | by Polkassembly | Medium](https://polkassembly.medium.com/creating-a-treasury-proposal-step-by-step-guide-e65ee1283193#:~:text=So%2C%20in%20the%20previous%20article,about%20making%20a%20treasury%20proposal)).  
   - **Team and Account Setup:** Make sure your team’s on-chain presence is established. Polkadot governance heavily favors transparency, so set up a **proposer account with an on-chain identity** (verify your identity by registering details on-chain). Also prepare a **beneficiary account** (where funds will be sent if approved) – ideally a **multisig wallet** controlled by core team members, to secure the funds and signal professional management ([Treasury Proposal Overview | Polkadot Handbook](https://polkadothandbook.com/guides/treasury-proposals#:~:text=You%20will%20need%20an%20account,account%20which%20is%20a%20multisig)).  
   - **Community Preliminary Discussion:** Although not strictly required, it’s highly recommended to **initiate a discussion on Polkadot forums** before formal submission ([Treasury Proposal Overview | Polkadot Handbook](https://polkadothandbook.com/guides/treasury-proposals#:~:text=A%20pre,put%20a%20proposal%20on%20chain)). You can create a post on [Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/) or the official Polkadot forum describing your BRC721 project and proposal idea. This allows you to gather feedback, address concerns, and gauge support. A **1–2 week discussion period** is advised to refine your proposal based on community input ([Treasury Proposal Overview | Polkadot Handbook](https://polkadothandbook.com/guides/treasury-proposals#:~:text=A%20pre,to%20two%20weeks%20is%20recommended)). Early engagement can also build credibility – community members will see that you are open to suggestions and aligning your plan with their feedback.

2. **Choosing the Right Funding Track:**  
   Polkadot OpenGov has multiple **treasury tracks** for proposals, distinguished mainly by the funding amount requested. Selecting the proper track is crucial, as it determines the voting thresholds and required deposit. The tracks commonly used for treasury spending are: **Small Spender**, **Medium Spender**, **Big Spender**, and **Treasurer** ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=cancellations%20and%20terminations%2C%20etc,funding%20from%20The%20Polkadot%20Treasury)). Each has an upper limit on the DOT amount you can request: Small Spender up to ~10,000 DOT, Medium Spender up to ~100,000 DOT, Big Spender up to ~1,000,000 DOT, and Treasurer (the largest) up to 10 million DOT ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,67%20million%20%24DOT%2C%20with)) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=%24DOT.%20,63%20million%20%24DOT)). For example, if your BRC721 development budget translates to requesting say 20,000 DOT, that falls under the *Medium Spender* track. Choose the track that fits your needs – **aiming lower than the maximum** for that track can improve your chances, since very large asks face higher scrutiny and tougher approval criteria. Keep in mind you will need to lock a deposit when submitting (100 DOT for Small, 200 DOT for Medium, 400 DOT for Big, etc.) ([Polkadot OpenGov Origins - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#:~:text=32%20Small%20Spender%2050%20100,1%20Day%20Linear%20Decreasing%20Reciprocal)). This deposit is returned if your proposal is approved, but will be burned (lost) if the proposal is rejected, as an anti-spam measure ([Creating a treasury proposal — Step by Step guide | by Polkassembly | Medium](https://polkassembly.medium.com/creating-a-treasury-proposal-step-by-step-guide-e65ee1283193#:~:text=,currently%20set%20at%20100%20DOTs)). Plan your request and track so that you don’t risk an unnecessarily high deposit or thresholds.

3. **On-chain Submission of the Proposal:**  
   Once your proposal text is polished and you’ve picked the track, it’s time to submit on-chain. The Polkadot community typically uses **Polkassembly or SubSquare UI** to facilitate this. Using Polkassembly’s interface for OpenGov Treasury proposals can simplify the process ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=Go%20to%20Polkassembly%20and%20click,Then)). The steps are:  
   - **Create a Proposal Preimage:** This is basically the transaction data that, if approved, will release the funds. It includes the **beneficiary account** (where the DOT will go) and the **amount** of DOT requested ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=Image%3A%20polkassembly)). Polkassembly’s guided form will help you input these. Double-check the beneficiary address and amount – they cannot be changed easily later.  
   - **Link to Your Proposal Description:** You will provide a description field, but on-chain storage is limited. Instead of pasting your entire document on-chain, you should **upload your full proposal document** separately (e.g., Google Docs or IPFS) and provide a link. Polkassembly allows you to enter a rich-text description and link for voters to read the details ([Treasury Proposal Overview | Polkadot Handbook](https://polkadothandbook.com/guides/treasury-proposals#:~:text=The%20proposal%20needs%20to%20be,PDF%20or%20Google%20Docs)). Make sure this description succinctly summarizes the ask and includes the link to the comprehensive doc.  
   - **Submit and Sign:** Initiate the proposal submission transaction from your proposer account (with sufficient DOT for the deposit). When you send it, the proposal enters the queue for the chosen track. On Polkassembly, it will appear as an active referendum with your description attached. At this point, the **28-day voting period** (for Polkadot) begins for most treasury tracks ([Polkadot OpenGov Origins - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-origins#:~:text=32%20Small%20Spender%2050%20100,1%20Day%20Linear%20Decreasing%20Reciprocal)). Your 200 DOT deposit (for example) is now locked on-chain pending the outcome.

4. **Socializing the Proposal and Gathering Support:**  
   Once the proposal is live on-chain, the real work begins: **convincing token holders to vote aye (yes)**. Polkadot’s governance is community-driven, so you need to reach out and make your case:  
   - **Announce on Community Channels:** Share the Polkassembly link to your proposal in key channels like the **Polkadot Watercooler and Polkadot Direction** chat rooms (official Element/Matrix channels for the community) ([Creating a treasury proposal — Step by Step guide | by Polkassembly | Medium](https://polkassembly.medium.com/creating-a-treasury-proposal-step-by-step-guide-e65ee1283193#:~:text=proposer%20,discord%20and%20telegram%2C%20inviting%20the)). Introduce yourself and the project, and invite people to discuss or ask questions. It’s also helpful to post on **Twitter (X)**, Polkadot Discords or Telegram groups, and any relevant developer channels – ensure more community members and DOT holders become aware of your referendum ([Creating a treasury proposal — Step by Step guide | by Polkassembly | Medium](https://polkassembly.medium.com/creating-a-treasury-proposal-step-by-step-guide-e65ee1283193#:~:text=proposer%20,discord%20and%20telegram%2C%20inviting%20the)).  
   - **Engage and Educate:** Be ready to **answer questions on Polkassembly or the forum**. Common questions might involve how BRC721 benefits Polkadot, why the budget is X DOT, or how you will handle technical risks. Respond promptly and thoroughly; **transparency and responsiveness** can significantly sway sentiment in your favor. If concerns arise (e.g. someone thinks the budget is too high), address them by clarifying or even adjusting scope if feasible.  
   - **Seek Endorsements:** If you have support from notable community members or parachain teams, ask them (informally) to comment or endorse the proposal publicly. For instance, if another parachain team sees value in a Bitcoin–Polkadot NFT bridge, their supportive comment can build trust.  
   - **Monitor Voting Progress:** Throughout the voting period, keep an eye on Polkadot governance platforms (like Polkassembly or Subscan) to see how much support vs. opposition the referendum is getting. If turnout is low or the approval is borderline, step up outreach in the remaining time. Sometimes, doing an **AMA (Ask Me Anything)** or joining a community call to present your proposal can rally more voters. Remember that under OpenGov, **votes are weighted by conviction and DOT stake**, so persuading a few large stakeholders who believe in your project can matter a lot.  

5. **Post-Decision Follow-up:**  
   - **If Approved:** Congratulations – your proposal passed! The requested DOT will be disbursed to the beneficiary (usually at the end of the spend period). At this point, **deliver on your milestones** as promised. It’s good practice to keep the community updated on your progress (through Polkassembly posts or forum updates). In fact, for multi-stage projects, you might later submit follow-up proposals for subsequent phases, and a track record of delivering phase 1 on time and budget will build confidence for future funding. Successful teams like those behind wallet apps have even posted public updates to show the work done with treasury funds ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,infrastructure%20and%20providing%20public%20services)).  
   - **If Rejected:** Don’t be discouraged. Review the outcome objectively – did discussions reveal major concerns? Perhaps voters felt the scope was unclear or the ask was too high. Gather feedback from comments and consider adjusting your proposal. You can refine the plan (or seek alternate funding like a Web3 Foundation grant) and try again. Note that if it was rejected, your deposit is burned ([Creating a treasury proposal — Step by Step guide | by Polkassembly | Medium](https://polkassembly.medium.com/creating-a-treasury-proposal-step-by-step-guide-e65ee1283193#:~:text=requires%20the%20creator%20of%20the,needs%20to%20be%20bonded%20by)), so make the next attempt count. Address the weaknesses before resubmission. Also, reach out diplomatically on forums to ask for guidance on how to improve; the community often appreciates perseverance if it comes with genuine improvements.

## 3. Criteria for Approval  
Polkadot’s DOT holders and governance participants evaluate proposals on several key criteria. Understanding these will help you tailor BRC721’s proposal to win approval:

- **Technical Merit and Feasibility:** Voters consider *how sound and innovative the project is*. Clearly articulate the technical approach for the BRC721 indexer (e.g. how you’ll track Bitcoin ordinals inscriptions and sync with the LAOS parachain, and any modifications to LAOS’s runtime). Highlight why your chosen design is effective and what tech challenges you’ve already overcome in the prototype stage. If possible, show a proof-of-concept or metrics (e.g. *“We have implemented BRC721 collection creation in phase 1, successfully minting X test NFTs on Bitcoin via LAOS”*). A technically solid plan with well-defined architecture and risks addressed will instill confidence.

- **Community and Ecosystem Benefit:** Polkadot’s treasury exists to fund projects that **benefit the Polkadot ecosystem as a whole** ([Polkadot’s on-chain Treasury. Bounties, tips, and spending proposals | by Pitcoin | Medium](https://medium.com/@pitcoin/polkadots-on-chain-treasury-6a1e9a690827#:~:text=It%20is%20essential%20that%20expenditures,of%20DOTs%20available%20for%20use)). You must draw a clear line from funding BRC721 to tangible benefits for Polkadot and its community. For example, explain how *dynamic NFTs bridging Bitcoin and Polkadot* can attract Bitcoin users to the Polkadot ecosystem, increase cross-chain activity, and demonstrate the power of Polkadot’s cross-chain technology. Emphasize any public-good aspects: will your code be open source for others to reuse? (Ideally yes, open-sourcing the BRC721 implementation and indexer so other parachains or developers can build on it). If the project could potentially provide infrastructure for **many dapps or parachains** (say a general indexer for Bitcoin-state to Polkadot), underline that broad usefulness. Community benefit also means addressing Polkadot’s priorities like decentralization and interoperability – luckily, BRC721 is all about interoperability, bridging vastly different networks.

- **Alignment with Polkadot’s Objectives:** Polkadot’s core mission is to enable a **multichain, interoperable Web3**. A proposal aligned with this mission is more likely to be approved. Frame BRC721 as an **interoperability project**: it connects Polkadot (through the LAOS parachain) with Bitcoin, enhancing Polkadot’s reach and showcasing its ability to integrate with external chains. If relevant, mention alignment with any Polkadot initiative or vision (for instance, Polkadot’s focus on cross-consensus messaging could eventually tie into how LAOS and Bitcoin communicate). Also note if your team has been involved in the Polkadot ecosystem (are you a parachain team, or did you go through the Substrate Builders Program or Web3 Foundation grants?). Voters tend to favor teams that have shown commitment to Polkadot’s ecosystem goals ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,the%20proposals%20are%20relatively%20reasonable)). In fact, many successful treasury proposals come from projects that *“already have exposure in the Polkadot ecosystem… and the continuity of the development roadmap is good, with reasonable direction and budget”* ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,the%20proposals%20are%20relatively%20reasonable)).

- **Deliverables and Accountability:** Treasury funding is public money, so proposals that demonstrate accountability get support. Break the project into **clear milestones** and deliverables, with approximate delivery dates. For example: *Milestone 1: Bitcoin-LAOS indexer MVP (deliverable: indexer that tracks basic NFT transfers) by Month X; Milestone 2: LAOS parachain upgrade for dynamic NFTs by Month Y; Milestone 3: Front-end integration and documentation by Month Z.* By specifying these, you show you have a plan to ship results. Also, indicating how you will measure success (KPIs) can help – e.g. *“success means the indexer can track 100% of BRC721 transactions in real-time, with X transactions per second capacity.”* If you plan an audit or community testing, mention those too. This level of detail proves you are results-oriented.

- **Budget Rationality:** The amount of DOT requested should **match the scope of work and market rates**. Voters will scrutinize if the budget seems inflated or conversely too low to achieve the goals. Provide a breakdown: development hours/cost, infrastructure or hosting costs, auditing costs, any additional personnel (e.g. hiring a security auditor or UI designer), etc. If your team members will be paid, list the roles and expected effort (e.g. 2 developers for 3 months each at a rate of $X/month, etc.). A well-justified budget shows you’ve done homework and are requesting *only what’s needed*. The community is more likely to approve funding that is **cost-effective for the value delivered**. On the other hand, unexplained large sums raise red flags. For context, note that Polkadot’s treasury has funded projects ranging from small <10k DOT initiatives up to big ventures in the hundreds of thousands DOT; your ask should feel reasonable for the problem you’re solving. In Polkadot OpenGov, **Medium Spender proposals (≤100k DOT)** have had a relatively good pass rate, whereas **Small Spender** (≤10k DOT) often get rejected (perhaps due to fixed overhead in voting effort) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,to%2010%2C000%20%24DOT%2C%20most%20of)) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,program%2C%20so%20the%20number%20of)). Very large asks go to Big Spender or Treasurer tracks and face higher “approval thresholds.” So, calibrate your budget to be as lean as possible while fully enabling the project.

- **Trust and Track Record:** Finally, proposals are more likely approved if the team is trusted to deliver. Factors that build trust include: having successfully delivered a **Web3 Foundation grant** or a previous treasury project, being a known parachain team or active open-source contributor, or collaboration with well-regarded ecosystem entities. If you or your team have such credentials, highlight them. Even if BRC721 is early-stage, mention any relevant experience (e.g. *“Team members previously contributed to XYZ Substrate module or have blockchain development experience at ABC company.”*). Additionally, having a verified on-chain identity (as mentioned) and public profiles helps. You might also get unofficial endorsements – for instance, if a respected Polkadot developer informally comments support, that vibe carries weight. Overall, demonstrate that *“the team structure is complete… development roadmap continuity is good… and the proposal’s direction and budget are reasonable”* ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,the%20proposals%20are%20relatively%20reasonable)), as this pattern has been observed in successful proposals.

## 4. Examples of Successful Proposals  
To inspire and guide your BRC721 treasury application, here are a few **case studies of projects that secured Polkadot Treasury funding** (and why they succeeded):

- **KILT Protocol’s Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP):** KILT, a parachain project, applied for funding to develop a **decentralized identity service** for Polkadot. This Medium Spender proposal (referendum #5) was approved, likely owing to KILT’s existing reputation as a parachain and a Web3 Foundation grant alumnus ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,the%20proposals%20are%20relatively%20reasonable)). They presented a clear technical plan to build identity infrastructure beneficial to many Polkadot users. The success underlines the value of being an established Polkadot project with a clear utility; KILT went on to deliver all milestones for DIP as promised (per community updates).

- **Subsquid – Data Indexing for Polkadot:** Subsquid, a blockchain data indexing framework, secured treasury funding (referendum #15) to build out indexing support for Polkadot networks ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,the%20proposals%20are%20relatively%20reasonable)). This is analogous to BRC721’s indexing needs, in that it was infrastructure crucial for many dApps. Subsquid’s proposal succeeded by emphasizing how a robust indexing solution would help multiple parachains and applications access on-chain data more efficiently. The team’s technical credentials and the cross-ecosystem benefit were key factors.

- **PolkaWorld Community Events & Marketing:** Not all funded proposals are pure tech – PolkaWorld, a community initiative, received treasury support for Polkadot marketing and educational outreach in China (proposal #4) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20KILT%20applies%20for,4)). They made a case that growing Polkadot’s user base through local content and meetups would benefit the network. Their success demonstrates that if your project has a strong community angle or educates users, it can be funded – but you must show a plan and community backing. In PolkaWorld’s case, the team was known in the community and had a clear event calendar and deliverables.

- **HydraDX & Allies – Multichain Audit Bounty:** An interesting example of a **treasury bounty**: HydraDX, together with Astar, Acala and several other parachains, proposed an audit fund (bounty) to cover security audits for projects in the ecosystem (referendum #47) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,of%20promoting%20the%20Polkadot%20ecosystem)). By **joining forces**, multiple teams signaled wide ecosystem support, and the proposal was framed as critical for the security of Polkadot’s DeFi landscape. The bounty mechanism allowed ongoing disbursement for audits of various projects. This was approved, showing that **collaboration among teams** and addressing a common need (security) is a winning strategy.

- **Tribe–XCM Relayer Incubator:** In another collaborative effort, a group of teams put forward the “Tribe Relayers” incubator (referendum #43) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,of%20promoting%20the%20Polkadot%20ecosystem)), aiming to develop cross-chain message relayers. This was a cross-chain infrastructure project – much like BRC721 is for cross-chain NFTs – and it succeeded by aligning with Polkadot’s goal of improving interoperability. Multiple parachains co-sponsored the proposal, underlining its broad importance. For BRC721, if you can get interest or support from other parachains (e.g. those focusing on NFTs or Bitcoin integration), it could similarly strengthen your case.

- **OnFinality – RPC Infrastructure:** OnFinality, a major infrastructure provider (offering node services and RPC endpoints), requested funds to cover free RPC services for Polkadot parachains (referendum #45) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,infrastructure%20and%20providing%20public%20services)). This proposal passed because it was clearly a **public good** – reliable infrastructure for all parachains to benefit from. The treasury recognized that funding such critical services accelerates growth for many projects. OnFinality had a strong track record and provided data on usage to justify the cost. For BRC721’s indexer, you might draw parallels: if the indexer will be open for any wallet or dApp to query Bitcoin NFT data, it similarly qualifies as public infrastructure that multiple projects might use.

- **Nova Wallet – Feature Development:** Nova, a popular mobile wallet, received treasury reimbursement for implementing new features (referendum #8) ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=,infrastructure%20and%20providing%20public%20services)). Notably, they delivered the features first and then applied for compensation, which showed good faith. They mapped each funded milestone to a feature that users could already try. This “retroactive funding” model is another approach – if BRC721’s team has resources to build an initial version, doing so and then asking the treasury to cover costs after demonstrating success can be compelling. It reduces perceived risk for voters.

Each of these examples illustrates different strengths: a well-known parachain project leveraging treasury for ecosystem tooling, a collaborative proposal uniting multiple teams, an infrastructure provider delivering broad value, and even non-technical community growth efforts. In every case, the **common thread** is a clear benefit to Polkadot and a trustworthy execution plan. When crafting your proposal, consider these precedents and how your project similarly meets the mark.

## 5. Best Practices for a Strong Application  
Successfully navigating Polkadot’s funding process requires more than just a good idea. Here are **best practices** to maximize your chances of approval:

- **Outline Clear Goals and Milestones:** Begin your proposal with a concise statement of your goal (e.g. *“Enable dynamic NFTs on Bitcoin via Polkadot by developing the BRC721 indexer and upgrading LAOS”*). Break the work into milestones with realistic timelines. This not only helps voters understand what they are funding, but also helps you manage the project. Each milestone should have specific deliverables (e.g. *“Milestone 1: Bitcoin block parser for NFTs (deliverable: open-source module on GitHub)”*). Clarity here convinces the community that you have a roadmap and aren’t asking for an open-ended sum. It’s wise to buffer your timeline a bit for unforeseen delays – being realistic is better than over-promising.

- **Detail the Deliverables:** For each milestone, describe **what the end result will be**. If it’s code, will it be open-sourced under a certain license? If it’s research, will you publish a report? For infrastructure, what performance or capacity will it handle? In BRC721’s case, a deliverable could be *“A cross-chain indexer service that captures all BRC721 events on Bitcoin and exposes them via API/Substrate RPC on the LAOS parachain.”* Perhaps another is *“Extension of LAOS parachain’s NFT palette to support dynamic metadata updates via XCM.”* By detailing these, you set correct expectations. Post-approval, you can then measure your output against these promised deliverables, which is exactly what the community will do when assessing your success.

- **Provide a Thoughtful Budget & Allocation:** As noted, break down your budget. It helps to present it in a table or list within the proposal. For example: *“Developer salaries: 2 developers for 4 months = 8 person-months at $5k/month = $40k (~8,000 DOT); Bitcoin node infrastructure: $3k (~600 DOT); Audit: $10k (~2,000 DOT); Contingency ~5%: $2.5k (~500 DOT). Total = ~11,100 DOT.”* Showing conversions to DOT and using conservative exchange rates can avoid future shortfall if DOT’s price fluctuates. Ensure **transparency on how funds will be used** – if any portion is for non-development costs (e.g. community testing incentives or travel to Polkadot events to present the project), list it. A common best practice is to **avoid asking for ongoing salaries or operational overhead** without deliverables; frame costs around specific outputs instead. If your project could generate revenue or has other funding sources, disclose them and clarify why treasury support is still needed (e.g. to accelerate development of a public-good feature that might not be immediately profitable). Being **financially prudent and honest** goes a long way.

- **Plan for Custody and Use of Funds:** Since the treasury typically disburses in one lump sum, outline how you will manage the funds. Mention that the DOT will be held in a multisig (give the address if available) and used only for the project. If you intend to convert some DOT to stablecoins or fiat for paying expenses, you might state that too, so voters aren’t surprised. By demonstrating you have a plan to handle funds responsibly (perhaps even using on-chain tools to trace spending or providing periodic expense reports), you build trust.

- **Leverage Polkadot’s Multi-Chain Strengths:** When writing the proposal, use language that resonates with Polkadot’s ethos. Highlight how BRC721’s success would showcase Polkadot’s interoperability (perhaps by using XCM or cross-consensus proofs between Bitcoin and Polkadot) – something **only Polkadot can do at scale**. Aligning with these strengths makes your proposal feel like a win for the ecosystem. Also consider if your project can integrate with other ongoing initiatives – for instance, if there’s a Polkadot NFT common-good chain or an indexing service, note how you’ll complement rather than duplicate efforts. This shows awareness of the bigger picture.

- **Community Engagement and Support:** As you prepare the proposal, quietly garner support. Talk to community members, perhaps present at a community call (like Polkadot Discord or a Parachain team’s public call) to introduce BRC721 conceptually. Incorporate feedback from those discussions. By the time you officially propose, you ideally have some known figures who can say “we’ve seen this project in discussion and it seems promising.” Additionally, remain active in community channels even outside your proposal. For example, help answer general questions about NFTs or Bitcoin bridging on Polkadot’s forums. This positions you as a contributor, not just someone appearing only to request funds. Polkadot’s culture values **open collaboration** – being a familiar and helpful face can indirectly benefit your cause.

- **Consider a Grant or Phased Approach:** One best practice seen in Polkadot is starting with a **Web3 Foundation grant or smaller treasury ask** to prove concept, then scaling up. If feasible, you might apply for a W3F *Open Grant* for an early part of BRC721 (such as writing the BRC721 specification or a prototype indexer). Completion of a grant is a strong signal when you later approach the treasury for larger funding – it shows external validation and that you deliver. If not a grant, you could also break the treasury ask into two sequential proposals: e.g. ask for a smaller amount to build the MVP, then later a second proposal for the full production build. Voters sometimes prefer this incremental funding because it reduces risk – they can assess phase 1 results before funding phase 2. Of course, ensure each phase is valuable on its own to justify funding.

- **Professional Presentation:** Treat the proposal like a formal application. Check spelling, grammar, and formatting in your documents and Polkassembly post. A well-structured proposal with headings, diagrams (if needed to explain architecture), and clear language will stand out. Remember, many voters will just read the Polkassembly summary and perhaps skim your attached document. Make their job easier by writing a compelling summary and **using visuals or charts** if it clarifies the concept (for example, a diagram of how Bitcoin and LAOS interact for BRC721 could help non-technical voters grasp it). An appendix with technical specs can be included for those who want deep details, while the main text stays accessible.

- **Compliance with Guidelines:** Ensure you meet any formal requirements. For instance, include your contact info, the team’s legal entity (if any), and state explicitly that *“All deliverables will be open-sourced and the project will abide by Polkadot’s open development principles”* (if true). While not strictly required, these statements reinforce that you understand the community’s expectations. Also, be mindful of the **treasury spend period timing** – Polkadot’s spend period is ~24 days ([Polkadot’s on-chain Treasury. Bounties, tips, and spending proposals | by Pitcoin | Medium](https://medium.com/@pitcoin/polkadots-on-chain-treasury-6a1e9a690827#:~:text=,Kusama%20Spending%20Period%3A%207%20days)). If your proposal passes near the end of a spend period, payout might come after that period ends. It’s a minor detail, but awareness of such nuances can show sophistication (though you don’t need to dwell on it in the proposal, just in timing expectations).

In summary, the best practices revolve around **being clear, reasonable, and community-oriented**. You want to convince voters that *“this team knows what they’re doing, this project is great for Polkadot, and the amount requested is well worth it.”* When those points come across, your proposal is in a strong position.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them  
Even promising proposals can stumble due to avoidable mistakes. Here are some common pitfalls observed in Polkadot Treasury applications, and tips on steering clear of them:

- **Unclear or Evolving Objectives:** If a proposal doesn’t clearly state what is being built or funded, or if it keeps changing scope in discussions, voters lose confidence. Avoid this by **nailing down the scope** in advance. Don’t propose a vague “we will improve NFT infrastructure” – be specific (e.g. “build a Bitcoin-Polkadot NFT indexer and integrate it with LAOS”). It’s fine if your project is complex, but describe it in digestible parts. Stick to the plan during the referendum; if you must adjust something based on feedback, explicitly update the proposal description so all voters see the final intended scope. Consistency and clarity will make voters comfortable that they know what they’re voting for.

- **Overambitious Timeline or Underestimating Challenges:** A very common pitfall is promising unrealistic delivery timelines or ignoring potential obstacles. For instance, building cross-chain functionality with Bitcoin is non-trivial – if you claim you’ll finish in one month, that’s not credible. Set a timeline that accounts for development, testing, audits, and even some buffer. Also acknowledge challenges in your plan: e.g. *“Bitcoin’s block intervals and lack of smart contracts mean our indexer must handle data carefully; we have accounted for this in our design.”* By showing you recognize the hard parts, you preempt critics. Conversely, avoid open-ended timelines (“we will deliver when it’s done”) – voters need to know *when* benefits will accrue.

- **Budget Inflation or Opaqueness:** Another pitfall is a budget that seems padded with unnecessary costs or missing detail. For example, requesting a large sum “for development” without breakdown, or including high administrative fees, will draw scrutiny. Some proposals have failed because the community felt the price tag was too high for the expected outcome. To avoid this, apply the best practice of transparency: itemize everything and sanity-check the total against similar projects or market rates. If your budget is large, defend it with rationale (maybe the project requires specialized expertise or significant computing resources – explain that). **Be prepared to trim** non-essential costs if feedback suggests the budget is a concern. It’s better to succeed with a leaner proposal than to fail for holding onto a marginal item. And never try to hide the use of funds – Polkadot’s community is quick to question ambiguous entries.

- **Insufficient Community Engagement:** Some proposals are submitted cold, with the proposer not interacting with the community at all, and they often fail. Polkadot is a social ecosystem; ignoring the discussion phase or not answering questions signals either arrogance or lack of preparedness. The pitfall is thinking “if the idea is good, it will pass on merit alone” – in reality, **process matters**. To avoid this: **be present and communicative**. As noted, start a dialogue on Polkassembly or the forum ahead of time, and **listen**. Sometimes proposers get defensive at criticism – a sure way to turn voters off. Instead, thank people for feedback, address it gracefully, and adjust your proposal if needed. Voters remember those interactions. Also, failing to campaign for your proposal (within reason) can be a pitfall; you shouldn’t assume people will notice it on their own. Without spamming, do actively share the proposal in relevant venues.

- **Ignoring Polkadot Governance Nuances:** If a proposer is clearly unfamiliar with how Polkadot’s governance works, it can hurt their case. For example, referencing the old Council system incorrectly, or not understanding the tracks, might make voters wary. Ensure you’ve done your homework on how OpenGov works (which this guide helps with). Tailor your submission to those rules: put the correct deposit, choose the right track, etc. Also, be mindful of the **decision thresholds** – higher tracks need more “aye” support. If you target the Big Spender track, realize you’ll need a supermajority in favor ([Polkadot OpenGov Overview. After the official launch of the… | by DFG Official | Medium](https://medium.com/@dfg-official/polkadot-opengov-overview-1ae64c0c2614#:~:text=cancellations%20and%20terminations%2C%20etc,funding%20from%20The%20Polkadot%20Treasury)). Ignoring these can doom a proposal (for instance, a few Big Spender proposals failed because they didn’t rally the ~50% support needed, whereas they might have passed as Medium Spenders). Avoid the mistake by structuring your request conservatively if possible (smaller track) and ensuring you rally sufficient votes.

- **Lack of Deliverable Accountability:** Some proposals in the past have been light on explaining how they will prove they achieved the goal. This raises concern that even if funded, the project might not deliver and there’d be nothing to show. To avoid this pitfall, emphasize how you will demonstrate success. Maybe you’ll publish the code and run a live demo for the community, or deliver a final report. If your project is software, you could commit to an audit at the end to validate the work. By providing these assurances, you counter the fear of “what if they get DOT and disappear?” which unfortunately has happened in a few cases (hence increased scrutiny nowadays). 

- **Reputation and Communication Issues:** Finally, a more subjective pitfall: if a proposer has a history of controversial projects or poor communication, the community may be skeptical. In your case, if you’re relatively new, you can only build a positive reputation from scratch – do so by being professional, courteous, and transparent. Avoid any behavior that could be perceived as rude or spammy during your campaign. And if there were any past failed attempts, address what’s different now. Essentially, **build trust** at every step to avoid any personal credibility pitfalls.

By anticipating these pitfalls and proactively addressing them, you greatly improve your proposal’s prospects. In short: **be clear, realistic, engaging, and reliable** – and your treasury application will avoid the common traps that lead others to rejection.

## 7. Useful Resources and Contacts  
Navigating the treasury process can be complex, but numerous resources and community contacts are available to help:

- **Polkadot Treasury Documentation (Wiki):** Start with the official Polkadot Wiki pages on the treasury and OpenGov. The wiki explains how the treasury is funded and spent, the concept of spend periods, and how OpenGov tracks work ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=The%20Treasury%20is%20a%20pot,internal%20logic%20can%20access%20it)) ([Treasury - Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#:~:text=,happen%20within%20a%20spend%20period)). It’s an invaluable reference for understanding governance terms and the latest rules (e.g., deposit requirements or track limits).

- **Polkassembly:** The Polkassembly platform is where you will likely host your proposal discussion and where on-chain proposals are mirrored with rich text. Browse [Polkadot Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/?/treasury) to see past Treasury proposals – you can filter by status to read approved ones and learn from their structure. Polkassembly also allows community members to comment and signal sentiment (via emoticons), which can be an early indicator of support. It’s essentially the forum for on-chain governance.

- **Polkadot Forum (forum.polkadot.network):** This is a newer official forum for deeper discussions on Polkadot governance and ecosystem topics. Many in the community, including parachain teams and governance experts, hang out here. You can post your proposal in the **Ecosystem category** for additional feedback. This forum is also where you’ll find announcements, like post-mortems of treasury proposals or new governance features. Engaging here can connect you with knowledgeable individuals who might advise on your proposal.

- **Element (Matrix) Chat Channels:** Polkadot’s community maintains official chat rooms on the Element (Matrix) network. Two highly relevant channels are **Polkadot Watercooler** (general community chat) and **Polkadot Direction** (focused on governance and proposal discussion) ([Creating a treasury proposal — Step by Step guide | by Polkassembly | Medium](https://polkassembly.medium.com/creating-a-treasury-proposal-step-by-step-guide-e65ee1283193#:~:text=proposer%20,discord%20and%20telegram%2C%20inviting%20the)). Joining these rooms (via the Element app or a Matrix client) will let you informally ask questions, share your Polkassembly post, and get quick feedback. Often, Treasury Council members (from the earlier governance model) or current Fellowship members are present and can provide insights. It’s also a place to gauge sentiment in real time.

- **Subsquare and OpenGov Tools:** [Subsquare](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/) and [Dotreasury](https://www.dotreasury.com/) are explorer tools for governance. Subsquare provides a dashboard of all referenda, including treasury ones, and statistics on voting. DoTreasury aggregates treasury data and sometimes includes analysis of spending. These tools help you track your proposal’s status and after completion, see the on-chain outcome and any disbursements. Familiarizing yourself with them can make the process more transparent (for example, confirming when exactly your proposal enters the deciding phase, or how many DOT have voted at any point).

- **Web3 Foundation Grants Program:** While separate from the on-chain treasury, the Web3 Foundation Grants can be a resource either for preliminary funding or just for guidance. The list of granted projects is public; if any are similar to yours, you can learn from their deliverables. Sometimes W3F staff or alumni are active in the community and could give advice on technical aspects of your proposal. If BRC721’s scope overlaps with grant themes, consider applying there as well (though do note you generally shouldn’t “double dip” for the exact same work – differentiate the scope if using both funding sources).

- **Key Community Contacts:** Within Polkadot’s ecosystem, some groups and individuals focus on helping proposals:
   - **Polkadot Ambassador Program:** Ambassadors are community leaders; some specialize in technical content or governance. They can often provide feedback or help amplify your proposal if it aligns with Polkadot’s mission. You can find them on the forum or at events. Don’t hesitate to respectfully reach out asking for a review or tips.  
   - **Treasury Guild / OpenGov Facilitators:** There are community-led initiatives (often on Discord or Element) where people discuss treasury proposals. For example, the *Treasury Guild* (if active) might host calls to let proposers pitch their ideas. Joining such groups can connect you to people who deeply understand the process.  
   - **Parachain Teams and Developers:** Since BRC721 touches a parachain (LAOS) and possibly others, connecting with parachain dev teams (like LAOS team, or other NFT-focused parachains) is useful. They might become allies in supporting your proposal, or at least advisors on technical integration. Polkadot hosts an annual DevCon (Sub0 conference) and regular meetups – networking there can put faces to names when it comes time for your proposal.

- **Previous Proposal Owners:** If you see a past successful treasury proposal similar in scope (for instance, the Subsquid team for indexing or someone who did a Bitcoin-related integration), consider reaching out to them (perhaps via Twitter or the forum). Many are open to sharing their experience – what hurdles they faced in governance, how they structured milestones, etc. Learning directly from those who went through it is extremely valuable.

- **Official Polkadot Communication Channels:** Keep an eye on Polkadot’s official blog and Twitter. Sometimes changes to the treasury process or new guidelines (like **Bounty Compliance Standards** ([Bounty Compliance Standards 1.0 - Polkadot Assembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1254.#:~:text=Bounty%20Compliance%20Standards%201.0%20,ensure%20that%20minimum%20standards)) or updates to governance parameters) are announced there. Being up-to-date ensures your proposal adheres to the latest standards. For example, if a new requirement is introduced (hypothetically, say, “all proposals must include a risk mitigation section”), you wouldn’t want to miss that memo.

In summary, take advantage of the rich support network in the Polkadot ecosystem. From documentation to interactive forums and chats, there’s a wealth of knowledge and people ready to help you refine your treasury proposal. By using these resources, you not only improve your application but also show the community you’re engaged – which in itself can positively influence how your BRC721 funding proposal is received.

---

**Conclusion:** Applying for Polkadot Treasury funding is a significant undertaking, but with thorough preparation and community alignment, it can greatly accelerate ambitious projects like BRC721. By understanding the funding avenues, following the proper process, meeting the approval criteria, learning from past successes, and employing best practices (while avoiding common mistakes), you put your proposal in the best possible position. Polkadot’s on-chain treasury embodies the ecosystem’s collaborative spirit – it is DOT holders investing in the network’s future. Frame your BRC721 proposal as a win-win for both your project and Polkadot’s vision of a connected, interoperable blockchain universe. With a solid plan and active engagement, you stand a strong chance of securing the support needed to bring inexpensive, dynamic Bitcoin NFTs to life within Polkadot’s multichain world.
